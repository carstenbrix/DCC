What is DCC++
DCC++ is an open-source hardware and software system for the operation of DCC-equipped model railroads.

The system consists of two parts, the DCC++ Base Station and the DCC++ Controller.

The DCC++ Base Station consists of an Arduino or ESP32 based micro controller fitted with an Arduino Motor Shield.
The motor shield can be connected directly to the tracks of a model railroad.
